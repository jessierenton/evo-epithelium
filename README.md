This repository contains all code and data used in the paper 'Evolution of cooperation on an epithelium' by Jessie Renton and Karen M. Page.

It is divided into three subdirectories: VTdyn contains the code for running Voronoi Tessellation model simulations, graph\_pd contains the code for running evolutionary graph theory simulations and data conatains all the data as well as code for processing data and plotting graphs.

See individual README.md files in the subdirectories for instructions on how to use the code, generate the data and reproduce figures.
